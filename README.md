NoLeary
================================
A Chrome extension that removes Kevin O'Leary from the Internet.

Trump showed the world how a shameless showman can troll his way to victory. O'Leary trumps even Trump when it comes to stagecraft. After all, [O'Leary has convinced many that he's a billionaire simply by playing one on TV](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob-magazine/kevin-oleary-hes-not-a-billionaire-he-just-plays-one-on-tv/article4564334/?page=all).
